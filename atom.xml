    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Quick Introduction</h2>

<p>My name is Ashley Fossile and I just started using static site generator to work with blogs. It took about 4 hours to finally get to this point. I had never really used the terminal to do a lot of heavy things, well heavy to me. I had to install RVM, git, and all that stuff, which I have never installed things in the terminal.</p>

<h3>On a more personal note&#8230;</h3>

<p>I am a student at UNLV. I am pursuing two bachelors of science, computer science and mathematics. The math part is easy for me, the CS, not so much, which should explain my 4 hours to just figure out this site generator thing.</p>

<h4>Anyways&#8230;</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m off to bed now. Hope no one is reading this :P</p>
